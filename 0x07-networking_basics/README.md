# Networking Basics

This project is part of my Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX. It's designed to help me understand fundamental networking concepts, including the OSI model, LAN (Local Area Network), WAN (Wide Area Network), IP addresses, localhost, subnets, and the differences between TCP and UDP protocols.

## Technologies

- Scripts are written in Bash 4.3.11(1).
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
