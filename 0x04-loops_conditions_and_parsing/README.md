# Loops, Conditions, and Parsing

This project was completed during my Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX. It focuses on the fundamentals of scripting in Bash, including loops (while, until, and for), conditional statements (if, else, elif, and case), shebangs, and SSH key creation.

## Technologies

- Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
- Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
